# Manual Deployment Guide

## Current Status ✅
The GitHub Actions workflow is **working** - it successfully builds your site and creates artifacts!

## What's Working:
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ Airtable data is fetched correctly
- ✅ Static files are generated (16.2 KB artifact)
- ✅ All pages are created (11 pages total)

## What's Not Working:
- ❌ GitHub Pages deployment (Git error)

## Quick Fix - Manual Deployment:

### Option 1: Download and Upload (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/Taras-Galper/Hanamal24-events/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Download the **"dist-files"** artifact (16.2 KB)
4. Extract the files
5. Go to: https://github.com/Taras-Galper/Hanamal24-events/settings/pages
6. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
7. Select **"main"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
8. Click **Save**

### Option 2: Push dist folder to main branch
```bash
# In your local project:
git add dist/
git commit -m "Add built site files"
git push origin main
```

Then enable GitHub Pages to deploy from the main branch.

## Your Site Will Be Live At:
**https://taras-galper.github.io/Hanamal24-events**

## The Build Process Works Perfectly:
- Fetches fresh data from Airtable
- Generates all static HTML files
- Creates sitemap.xml and robots.txt
- Includes all your packages and content

The only issue is the GitHub Pages deployment step, which we can work around! 🚀
