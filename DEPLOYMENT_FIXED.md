2. Handles errors gracefully (Menus table 403 error)
3. Uses fallback content when needed
4. Generates static HTML files
5. Copies files to root for GitHub Pages

### Contact Form:
- **Primary**: Make.com webhook to Airtable
- **Fallback 1**: Email client with pre-filled data
- **Fallback 2**: Local storage for manual processing
- **Admin**: View leads at `/admin/`

### Error Handling:
- Menus table 403 error → Uses fallback menus
- Airtable connection issues → Uses static content
